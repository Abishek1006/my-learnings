1.Time Complexity:
Operation	    Linear Search	Binary Search (sorted)
Best Case	    O(1)	            O(1)
Average Case	O(n)	            O(log n)
Worst Case	    O(n)	            O(log n)

2.When to Use:
    Use linear search if the list is unsorted or small.
    Use binary search if the list is sorted and performance is critical.
