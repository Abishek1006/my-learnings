1.Why are data structures and algorithms important here?
    Efficient inventory management involves fast lookup, updates, and deletions. Without the right data structure, these operations could become 
    slow and impact performance as inventory grows
    
2.Which data structures are suitable?
    HashMap: Maps productId â†’ Product, giving O(1) time for add, update, delete, and search

3.Analysis
Operation	        HashMap Time Complexity
Add Product	        O(1) average case
Update Product	    O(1) average case
Delete Product	    O(1) average case
View Inventory	    O(n) (where n = number of products)

4.optimizations
    If the product ID is known, HashMap gives constant time operations ,to sort or search by other fields like productName, 
    you could use a secondary data structure or apply sorting/searching techniques as needed
